# IBM_challenge_Cricket_Pose_estimation

One of the most apparent dimensions applicable to pose estimation is
tracking and measuring human activity and movement. Many architectures
like OpenPose, PoseNet, and DensePose are often practiced for action,
gesture, or gait recognition. We have used human pose estimation in the
field of cricket for the following:

1. Identifying different batting shots
2. Check if a bowler has legal action or not.
3. Cricket Umpire signal Identification.
